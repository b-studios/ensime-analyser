# ENSIME Analyser Test project

This is a spike to show ensime being used an api - improvements coming.


To play with it:

* Run genEnsime on an existing project.
* run org.ensime.analyser.AnalysisMain <.ensime_file_path> <opt:package>

If it specify a package then the searches will be limited to that package otherwise they will include the root package and all project dependencies.
